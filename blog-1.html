              In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in
              which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
              the left child and the right child. A recursive definition using
              just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a
              tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set
              and S is a singleton set containing the root. Some authors allow
              the binary tree to be the empty set as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a graph theory perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as
              defined here are arborescences. A binary tree may thus be also
              called a bifurcating arborescence—a term which appears in some
              very old programming books,before the modern computer science
              terminology prevailed. It is also possible to interpret a binary
              tree as an undirected, rather than a directed graph, in which case
              a binary tree is an ordered, rooted tree.Some authors use rooted
              binary tree instead of binary tree to emphasize the fact that the
              tree is rooted, but as defined above, a binary tree is always
              rooted.A binary tree is a special case of an ordered K-ary tree,
              where k is 2.
            </p>
            <p>
              In mathematics, what is termed binary tree can vary significantly
              from author to author. Some use the definition commonly used in
              computer science, but others define it as every non-leaf having
              exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right)
              the children either
            </p>
            <p>
              In computing, binary trees are used in two very different ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First, as a means of accessing nodes based on some value or
                label associated with each node.Binary trees labelled this way
                are used to implement
                <a href="/wiki/Binary_search_tree" title="Binary search tree"
                  >binary search trees</a
                >
                and
                <a href="/wiki/Binary_heap" title="Binary heap">binary heaps</a
                >, and are used for efficient
                <a href="/wiki/Search_algorithm" title="Search algorithm"
                  >searching</a
                >
                and
                <a href="/wiki/Sorting_algorithm" title="Sorting algorithm"
                  >sorting</a
                >. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even
                when there is only one child present matters in some of these
                applications, in particular, it is significant in binary search
                trees. However, the arrangement of particular nodes into the
                tree is not part of the conceptual information. For example, in
                a normal binary search tree the placement of nodes depends
                almost entirely on the order in which they were added, and can
                be re-arranged (for example by
                <a
                  href="/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree"
                  title="Self-balancing binary search tree"
                  >balancing</a
                >) without changing the meaning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, as a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating
                structure. In such cases, the particular arrangement of nodes
                under and/or to the left or right of other nodes is part of the
                information (that is, changing it would change the meaning).
                Common examples occur with
                <a href="/wiki/Huffman_coding" title="Huffman coding"
                  >Huffman coding</a
                >
                and
                <a
                  href="/wiki/Cladograms"
                  class="mw-redirect"
                  title="Cladograms"
                  >cladograms</a
                >. The everyday division of documents into chapters, sections,
                paragraphs, and so on is an analogous example with n-ary rather
                than binary trees.
